# BRE Editor React (Standalone Server)

This version runs both the frontend (React build) and backend (Node.js Express) from a single folder.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open terminal in this folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

This will show the BRE Rules Editor and let you edit fields live from your actual JSON.
